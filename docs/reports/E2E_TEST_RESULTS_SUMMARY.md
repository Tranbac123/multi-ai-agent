## 🚀 **How to Use the E2E Framework**

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

# Run E2E tests
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v --tb=short -m "not slow"
```

### **Individual Test Suites**

```bash
# Performance tests (100% success)
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/test_performance_e2e.py -v

# User workflow tests (60% success)
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/test_user_workflows.py -v

# Service integration tests (29% success)
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/test_service_integration.py -v
```

### **Specific Test Categories**

```bash
# Run only passing tests
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/ -v -k "test_response_time_benchmarks or test_concurrent_load_performance or test_memory_usage_stability or test_end_to_end_latency or test_error_recovery_performance or test_chatbot_user_journey or test_data_retrieval_workflow or test_tools_service_integration or test_config_service_workflow or test_policy_adapter_workflow or test_router_service_workflow or test_error_handling_across_services or test_concurrent_requests_across_services"

# Run performance tests only
python3 -m pytest tests/e2e/test_performance_e2e.py -v
```
