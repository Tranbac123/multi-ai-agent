# 🔧 Connection Fix Complete

## ✅ **Problem Resolved!**

Your "Unable to connect to the server" error has been fixed. Here's what was happening and what I did:

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

**Issue:** Services were not running properly after a restart

- ❌ API Gateway was down
- ❌ Chatbot Frontend was down
- ❌ This caused the "Unable to connect to the server" error

### 🛠️ **Fixes Applied**

1. **✅ Restarted API Gateway**

   - Container was not running
   - Restarted with `docker-compose up -d api-gateway`
   - Now healthy and responding

2. **✅ Restarted Chatbot Frontend**

   - Container was not running
   - Restarted with `docker-compose up -d ai-chatbot`
   - Now serving on http://localhost:3001

3. **✅ Verified All Connections**
   - API Gateway: ✅ http://localhost:8000
   - Chatbot Frontend: ✅ http://localhost:3001
   - Database: ✅ Connected
   - Redis: ✅ Connected

## 🧪 **Current Status**

### **✅ Working Services:**

- **API Gateway:** http://localhost:8000 ✅
- **Chatbot Frontend:** http://localhost:3001 ✅
- **Database:** PostgreSQL ✅
- **Cache:** Redis ✅
- **Message Broker:** NATS ✅

### **⚠️ Remaining Issue:**

- **OpenAI API Key:** Still using placeholder key
- **Result:** Chatbot responds but can't get AI responses

## 🚀 **Test Your Chatbot Now**

1. **Open your chatbot:** http://localhost:3001
2. **Send a message:** Type "Hello" and press Enter
3. **Expected result:** You'll see the error message about AI service connection (this is expected until you add a real API key)

## 🔑 **Next Step: Add Real API Key**

To get actual AI responses, you need to:

1. **Get OpenAI API Key:**

   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new secret key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

2. **Update .env file:**

   ```bash
   # Replace this line in your .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here-...

   # With your real key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart API Gateway:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml restart api-gateway
   ```

## 🧪 **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# Test API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz

# Test Chatbot Frontend
curl -I http://localhost:3001/

# Test Chat Endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Hello", "session_id": "test"}'
```
